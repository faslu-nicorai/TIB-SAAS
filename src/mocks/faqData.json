    "question": "What is Inspektra?",
    "answer": "Inspektra is a complete end-to-end operations platform for inspection, testing, and field-service companies. It replaces manual paperwork, WhatsApp follow-ups, spreadsheets, and disconnected tools by providing one unified system for enquiries, quotations, job scheduling, field inspections, digital report creation, certificate issuance, invoicing, and client communication. Each organization (tenant) gets its own secure workspace with tools for staff, inspectors, and clients."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is Inspektra multi-tenant? How does it work?",
    "answer": "Yes. Each company using Inspektra gets its own isolated environment, including dedicated dashboards for staff, inspectors, and clients. This ensures data security, role-based access, and complete separation between tenants. For example, TIB is one tenant inside Inspektra’s multi-tenant ecosystem."
  },

  {
    "question": "Do you offer onboarding or setup assistance?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Does Inspektra support custom report templates?",
    "answer": "Yes. Inspektra includes a powerful drag-and-drop Template Builder that lets you create fully customized inspection forms and certificate layouts. Inspectors fill these templates during on-site work, and the system automatically generates reports and certificates."
